Effective Date: April 5, 2025

Welcome to VideoToWallpaper! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the VideoToWallpaper mobile application ("App"), developed by MiniPanda ("we," "us," "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1. Description of the App
VideoToWallpaper allows you to convert videos from your iPhone Photos Library into Live Photos, which can be used as wallpapers on iOS devices. The App requires access to your Photos Library to select videos and save the resulting Live Photos.

2. Use of the App
The App is intended for personal, non-commercial use only.
You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you must have parental or guardian consent.
You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the App and not to use it for illegal purposes, including violating copyright laws related to videos or distributing harmful content.
You may not share or transfer your access to the App to others.

3. License
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App in accordance with these Terms.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, decompile, attempt to extract the source code, or use the App for commercial purposes or sublicense its components.

4. Freemium and PRO Purchase
The App is free to use with a limit of creating up to 3 Live Photos.
To remove this limit and unlock unlimited use, you may purchase the PRO version via a one-time in-app purchase ("PRO"). The price and terms are displayed within the App and may be updated from time to time.
Payments are processed by Apple through the App Store and are subject to its refund policies (https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223). All sales are final unless otherwise determined by Apple. Refunds are not guaranteed by us.

5. Permissions
The App requires access to your Photos Library to select videos and save Live Photos. This permission is used solely for the App’s functionality and does not involve collecting or storing your personal data. You may revoke Photos Library access at any time through your iOS device settings, though this will limit the App’s functionality.

6. Intellectual Property
All rights to the App, including its design, code, and functionality, belong to MiniPanda.
You are responsible for the videos you upload into the App. By using the App, you confirm you have the right to use this content. You may not use any App content (e.g., icons, graphics) outside the App without our written permission.

7. Advertising and Analytics
We may promote the App through third-party platforms, such as Facebook Ads and Google AdMob. To support this, we use the Facebook SDK and Google AdMob, which collect limited data (e.g., Device ID) for analytics and ad performance tracking. This data collection occurs only with your explicit consent via the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt. See our Privacy Policy for details.

8. Limitation of Liability
The App is provided "as is." We do not guarantee it will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with all devices.
We are not liable for any damages arising from your use or inability to use the App, including loss of data or content. You are responsible for backing up your Live Photos or other data created through the App. We are not liable for any loss of such data. Our total liability to you shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App, if any.

9. Changes and Termination
We may update these Terms at any time. The updated version will take effect upon posting at https://videotowallpaper.com/terms.html and will be notified via an in-app notification or email where applicable.
We reserve the right to discontinue the App or restrict access to it without prior notice.

10. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of Ukraine, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms will be resolved through negotiation or, if necessary, in the courts of Ukraine.

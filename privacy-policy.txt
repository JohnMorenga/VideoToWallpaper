Privacy Policy for VideoToWallpaper
Effective Date: April 5, 2025

MiniPanda ("we," "us," "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information related to your use of the VideoToWallpaper mobile application ("App").

1. Information We Collect
Photos Library Access: The App requires access to your iPhone Photos Library to select videos and save Live Photos. We do not collect, store, or share your photos or videos.
Analytics Data: We use the Facebook SDK to collect limited data, such as your Device ID, for advertising and analytics purposes (e.g., tracking app installs and ad performance).
No Personal Data: We do not collect personal information like your name, email, or location unless you contact us directly.

2. How We Use Information
App Functionality: Photos Library access is used solely to convert videos into Live Photos and save them back to your device.
Analytics and Advertising: Data collected via the Facebook SDK helps us measure ad performance, optimize campaigns, and improve the App. This data is anonymized and used in aggregate form.
Support: If you email us, we use your contact information only to respond to your inquiry.

3. How We Share Information
We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:
Facebook: Limited analytics data (e.g., Device ID) is shared with Facebook via the SDK for ad tracking, as described in their Data Policy.
Google AdMob: Limited analytics data (e.g., Device ID) is shared with Google AdMob for ad tracking, as described in their Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).
Service Providers: We may use third-party services for analytics or hosting, but they do not access your personal data.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose data if required by law.

4. Storage and Security
We do not store your photos, videos, or Live Photos. All processing occurs on your device.
Analytics data collected via the Facebook SDK is stored securely by Facebook per their policies.
We take reasonable steps to protect data, but no system is 100% secure.

5. Your Rights
You can revoke Photos Library access at any time through your iPhone settings, though this will limit the Appâ€™s functionality.
To opt out of analytics tracking, you can disable ad tracking in your device settings (e.g., Limit Ad Tracking on iOS).
Contact us at minipanda@ukr.net with any privacy questions or requests.

6. Children
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from them.

7. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy. The latest version will be posted on our website [e.g., videotowallpaper.com/privacy].
